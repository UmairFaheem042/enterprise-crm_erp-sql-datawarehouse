Welcome to the Data Warehouse Project! This project is designed to help you practice SQL, schema design, and ETL concepts using the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers). It involves building a data warehouse system using synthetic CRM and ERP data, and the entire process will guide you through each layer, from raw data ingestion to business-ready analytics.
